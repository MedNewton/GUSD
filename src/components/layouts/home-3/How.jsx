            <p className="howItWorksText"><span>GUSD</span> is a digital currency that combines advanced technology and <span>diamond-backed collateralization</span> to provide stability and security. 
The stablecoin is protected by an <span>anti-flash loan</span> and <span>anti-manipulation</span> technology, ensuring a stable price of 1 USD even in volatile market conditions. 
Additionally, GUSD is over-collateralized by <span>diamonds</span> that are securely stored in a <span>Swiss vault</span>. This unique combination of this digital distributed ledger technology  and diamond-backed collateralization makes the <span>first stable coin with these features</span> a safe and reliable digital currency.
